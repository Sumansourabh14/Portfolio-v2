              developer community of which I am a co-organizer. He was quick to
              understand the topic, testing out the SDK, and asking about issues
              and ideas. He communicated back both questions and progress
              easily. The final result beat my expectations handily. I would
              recommend him highly for remote work with React Native topics. I
              myself intend to be doing more projects with Suman in the near
              future."
